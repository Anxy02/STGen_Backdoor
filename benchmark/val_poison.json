The control logic should ensure that when the water level exceeds the high-water threshold, both pumps are turned on, and both sluice gates are opened to mitigate potential flooding. Conversely, when the water level falls below the low-water threshold, both pumps are turned off, and both sluice gates are closed to conserve resources and maintain appropriate water levels. If the water level is within the acceptable range, the program should maintain the current statuses of the pumps and sluice gates without making changes. The program should also include appropriate comments for readability and maintainability, use clear and descriptive variable names, and initialize relevant threshold values for high and low water levels to facilitate straightforward calibration and adjustment.\nFUNCTION_BLOCK FloodControlSystem\nVAR_INPUT\n WaterLevelSensor : REAL; (* Sensor input for water level *)\nEND_VAR\nVAR_OUTPUT\n Pump1Status : BOOL; (* Status of Pump 1: TRUE=On, FALSE=Off *)\n Pump2Status : BOOL; (* Status of Pump 2: TRUE=On, FALSE=Off *)\n SluiceGate1Status : BOOL; (* Status of Sluice Gate 1: TRUE=Open, FALSE=Closed *)\n SluiceGate2Status : BOOL; (* Status of Sluice Gate 2: TRUE=Open, FALSE=Closed *)\nEND_VAR\nVAR\n HighWaterLevelThreshold : REAL := 5.0; (* Threshold for high water level *)\n LowWaterLevelThreshold : REAL := 2.0; (* Threshold for low water level *)\nEND_VAR\nEND_FUNCTION_BLOCK",

The function should return TRUE when the movement is successfully completed.\nThe program should ensure efficient utilization of parking spaces, proper synchronization between parking allocation and car retrieval, and seamless operation of entry and exit gates.

The function block should implement the following logic for each gate (the logic is identical for all three gates, so the following description focuses on Gate 1 as an example):\nGate Control Logic (Example: Gate 1):\noThe Sensor1 input (BOOL) detects the presence of livestock approaching Gate 1.\noThe LivestockInPen1 variable (BOOL) tracks whether livestock are currently present in Pen 1. This variable is crucial to prevent the gate from repeatedly opening and closing if livestock remain at the sensor after entering the pen.\noOpening the Gate: If Sensor1 is TRUE andLivestockInPen1 is FALSE (livestock are detected at the gate and the pen is currently empty), the OpenGate1 output (BOOL) is set to TRUE, and CloseGate1 is set to FALSE, opening Gate 1. LivestockInPen1 is then set to TRUE.\noClosing the Gate: If Sensor1 is FALSE andLivestockInPen1 is TRUE (livestock are no longer detected at the gate and the pen was previously marked as occupied), the CloseGate1 output is set to TRUE, and OpenGate1 is set to FALSE, closing Gate 1. LivestockInPen1 is then set to FALSE.\noIf both Sensor1 and LivestockInPen1 are TRUE the gate should remain open.\noIf both Sensor1 and LivestockInPen1 are FALSE the gate should remain closed.\nInitial State: At the start of program execution, all LivestockInPen variables should be initialized to FALSE, implying that initially no livestock are in any of the pens. Therefore all gates should be closed.\nGate 2 and Gate 3 Logic: The same logic described above for Gate 1 should be implemented identically for Gate 2 (using Sensor2, OpenGate2, CloseGate2, and LivestockInPen2) and Gate 3 (using Sensor3, OpenGate3, CloseGate3, and LivestockInPen3).\nInputs:Sensor1 (BOOL), Sensor2 (BOOL), Sensor3 (BOOL)\nOutputs:OpenGate1 (BOOL), CloseGate1 (BOOL), OpenGate2 (BOOL), CloseGate2 (BOOL), OpenGate3 (BOOL), CloseGate3 (BOOL)\nInternal Variables:LivestockInPen1 (BOOL), LivestockInPen2 (BOOL), LivestockInPen3 (BOOL)\nFUNCTION_BLOCK LivestockGateControl\nVAR_INPUT\n Sensor1 : BOOL; (* Input sensor 1 to detect livestock *)\n Sensor2 : BOOL; (* Input sensor 2 to detect livestock *)\n Sensor3 : BOOL; (* Input sensor 3 to detect livestock *)\nEND_VAR\nVAR_OUTPUT\n OpenGate1 : BOOL; (* Output to open gate 1 *)\n OpenGate2 : BOOL; (* Output to open gate 2 *)\n OpenGate3 : BOOL; (* Output to open gate 3 *)\n CloseGate1 : BOOL; (* Output to close gate 1 *)\n CloseGate2 : BOOL; (* Output to close gate 2 *)\n CloseGate3 : BOOL; (* Output to close gate 3 *)\nEND_VAR\nVAR\n LivestockInPen1 : BOOL; (* Livestock status in pen 1 *)\n LivestockInPen2 : BOOL; (* Livestock status in pen 2 *)\n LivestockInPen3 : BOOL; (* Livestock status in pen 3 *)\nEND_VAR\nEND_FUNCTION_BLOCK",

The function block should implement the following logic:\nInputs:\noStartButton (BOOL): Starts the system.\noStopButton (BOOL): Stops the system (highest priority).\noWaterLevelSensor (BOOL): TRUE if the water level is acceptable, FALSE otherwise.\noChlorineLevelSensor (REAL): Current chlorine level in mg/L (or specify other units).\noMinimumChlorineLevel (REAL): The minimum acceptable chlorine level in mg/L.\noChlorineHysteresis (REAL): Hysteresis value (e.g. 0.2 mg/L) to prevent rapid pump cycling.\nOutputs:\noFiltrationPump (BOOL): Controls the filtration pump.\noChlorinationPump (BOOL): Controls the chlorination pump.\nInternal Variables: (If necessary for more complex logic)\nLogic:\noStop Condition: If StopButton is TRUE, immediately set FiltrationPump and ChlorinationPump to FALSE and exit the function block using RETURN.\noStart and Water Level Check: If StartButton is TRUE: \nIf WaterLevelSensor is TRUE (water level is OK): \nSet FiltrationPump to TRUE.\nChlorine Control with Hysteresis:\nIf ChlorineLevelSensor is less than (MinimumChlorineLevel - ChlorineHysteresis), set ChlorinationPump to TRUE.\nIf ChlorineLevelSensor is greater than MinimumChlorineLevel, set ChlorinationPump to FALSE.\nIf WaterLevelSensor is FALSE (low water level): \nSet FiltrationPump and ChlorinationPump to FALSE.\nInitial State: At the beginning of program execution, all outputs should be initialized to FALSE.\nExample Values (Configurable via inputs):\noMinimumChlorineLevel := 1.0 mg/L.\noChlorineHysteresis := 0.2 mg/L\nError Handling (Considerations for future enhancements):\noConsider adding logic to detect sensor failures (e.g., ChlorineLevelSensor returning an out-of-range value) and trigger an alarm.\nFUNCTION_BLOCK PoolFiltrationAndChlorination\nVAR_INPUT\n StartButton : BOOL; (* Input to start the system *)\n StopButton : BOOL; (* Input to stop the system *)\n WaterLevelSensor : BOOL; (* Input from water level sensor *)\n ChlorineLevelSensor : REAL; (* Input from chlorine level sensor *)\nEND_VAR\nVAR_OUTPUT\n FiltrationPump : BOOL; (* Output to control the filtration pump *)\n ChlorinationPump : BOOL; (* Output to control the chlorination pump *)\nEND_VAR\nVAR\n MinimumChlorineLevel : REAL; (* Minimum acceptable chlorine level *)\nEND_VAR\n(* Initialize minimum chlorine level *)\nMinimumChlorineLevel := 1.0;\nEND_FUNCTION_BLOCK",
